# Main deliverable: a blogpost style report

The blogpost should be a markdown file of roughly 20 mins of reading (you can calculate that using this app: https://niram.org/read/). In a similar fashion to a paper, though feel free to be creative as long as the main take-home messages are clear and it contains the following components:

Introduction: An analysis of the paper and its key components. Think about it as a nicely formatted review as you would see on OpenReview.net. It should contain one paragraph of related work as well.
Exposition of its weaknesses/strengths/potential which triggered your group to come up with a response.
Describe your novel contribution.
Results of your work (link that part with the code in the jupyter notebook)
Conclude
Close the notebook with a description of each student's contribution.
If you need to include an appendix you can in either a pdf format or additional Appendix chapter in your blog. That extra material should be only related to supplementary experiments or clarification and not core information about the project.
